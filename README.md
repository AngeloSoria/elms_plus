# DISCONTINUED
I made this extension for my school because I was bored and to practice my Javascript skills and to gain more knowledge.

But apparently there's a rabbit hole I need to go into before I complete this project.

One of it is forking the OAuth of Microsoft Account from the NeoLMS feature that I shouldn't do because it goes outside the Terms of Service of [CYPHER Learning](https://www.cypherlearning.com/).
