# DISCONTINUED
I made this extension for my school because I was bored and to practice my Javascript skills to gain more knowledge.
But apparently there's a rabbit hole I need to go into before I complete this project.
One of it is forking the OAuth of Microsoft Account from the NeoLMS feature that I shouldn't do because it goes outside the TOS of the beholder. (I don't want to get suspended :D)

- TODO live count.
- Custom Notification Sound (No more **BLING!**)
